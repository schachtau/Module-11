This module involves scraping data from the Mars News website. The code, along with the use of Beautiful Soup, allows us to "web scrape" specifically using HTML parsing and automated browsing. These rely on Python libraries as dependencies for our code and intended outcome.

We used automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and extract the titles and preview text of news articles in order to find the data needed to analyze the temperature data in part 2. 

To run the Mars scraping code, use the following command-
python part_1_mars_news.py This will output the titles and previews of the latest Mars news.

The second part of the project focuses on scraping temperature data from the Mars Temperature Data website. It provides both the weather table and a review of vital weather metrics on Mars. The "bash" command will output the weather table and provide an analysis of average temperature and atmospheric pressure over different Martian months.

This project demonstrates the use of web scraping techniques to gather data about Mars and perform meaningful research. Humans are slowly ruining our planet and data on Martian weather patterns may come in useful someday.
